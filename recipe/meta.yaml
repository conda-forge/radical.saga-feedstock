  summary: RADICAL SAGA (Simple API for Grid Applications) defines a high-level interface to the most commonly used distributed computing functionality.
  description: |
    RADICAL SAGA provides an access-layer and mechanisms for distributed infrastructure components like job 
    schedulers, file transfer and resource provisioning services. Given the heterogeneity of 
    distributed infrastructure, SAGA provides a much needed interoperability layer that lowers the 
    complexity and improves the simplicity of using distributed infrastructure whilst enhancing 
    the sustainability of distributed applications, services and tools.
